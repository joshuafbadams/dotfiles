dotfiles
========
This repo holds configuration files that make my workspace work the way I want it to. It's constantly evolving and changing so this repo will keep everything in once place. If you take a look and find anything interesting feel free to use it!

#Install
Want to easily symlink the files? Use [homesick](https://github.com/technicalpickles/homesick)! Be aware that doing this will probably overwrite your old dotfiles.

    1. gem install homesick

    2. homesick clone joshuafbadams/dotfiles

    3. homesick symlink joshuafbadams/dotfiles
